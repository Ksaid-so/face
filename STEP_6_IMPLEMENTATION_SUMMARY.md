- Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV)

### 2. Report Types

#### Sales Report
- Total sales transactions and revenue analysis
- Daily sales trends with visual charts
- Top selling products identification
- Recent sales transactions listing

#### Inventory Report
- Product stock level analysis
- Low stock and overstock alerts
- Inventory value by category breakdown
- Cost and profit margin calculations

#### Profit Report
- Revenue vs. cost of goods analysis
- Gross and net profit calculations
- Profit margin percentages
- Operating expenses tracking

#### Customer Report

- Purchase frequency analysis

### 3. Reports Dashboard UI
- Interactive reports page with tabbed interface
- Date range selector for custom reporting periods
- Export functionality for all report types
- Visual data representation using charts and graphs
- Responsive data tables with sorting capabilities

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Backend Architecture
- RESTful API endpoints using Next.js App Router
- Database queries optimized for reporting needs
- Proper error handling and validation
- Authentication and authorization checks

#### Frontend Components
- React components with TypeScript type safety
- Recharts library for data visualization
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- State management using React hooks

#### Security Considerations
- JWT token validation for API access
- Role-based access control
- Row Level Security (RLS) implementation
- Proper session management

## Key Files Created/Modified

### API Routes
- `/src/app/api/reports/route.ts` - Main reports API endpoint

### Frontend Pages
- `/src/app/reports/page.tsx` - Reports dashboard UI

### Components
- Updated navigation in `/src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx` to include Reports link

### Documentation
- `SALES_REPORTING_AND_ANALYTICS.md` - Detailed documentation
- `STEP_6_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Module Resolution Issues
- Fixed bcrypt module conflicts between server and client-side code
- Separated server-side and client-side functionality in BoltAuth class
- Proper type definitions for NextAuth session handling

### 2. Dynamic Route Conflicts
- Resolved conflicting dynamic route segments in products API
- Consolidated product-related routes under consistent naming

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Implemented efficient database queries for reporting
- Added proper indexing considerations
- Optimized data transformation for visualization

## Testing Approach

### API Testing
- Manual testing of report generation endpoints
- Verification of different report types and date ranges
- Export functionality validation

### UI Testing
- Responsive design verification
- Chart rendering and interaction testing
- Data table functionality checks

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Analytics
- Predictive sales forecasting
- Customer behavior pattern analysis
- Inventory demand planning algorithms

### Export Features
- PDF report generation
- Excel export with formatting
- Scheduled report delivery

### Visualization Improvements
- Interactive dashboards
- Real-time data updates
- Custom report templates

## Usage Examples

### Generate Sales Report (API)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/reports?type=sales&startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31"
```

### Export Inventory Report as CSV
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/reports?type=inventory&format=csv"
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses
- 401 Unauthorized - Missing or invalid authentication
- 400 Bad Request - Invalid parameters
- 500 Internal Server Error - Processing failures

### Client-Side Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for async operations
- Graceful degradation for failed requests

## Conclusion

The Sales Reporting and Analytics system provides comprehensive business intelligence capabilities essential for effective inventory and sales management. The implementation follows modern web development practices with proper separation of concerns, security considerations, and performance optimizations.

This completes Step 6 of the roadmap. The system is now ready for integration with the existing POS and inventory management features, providing valuable insights into business performance.
