# Sales Reporting and Analytics System

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Sales Reporting and Analytics system for the Inventory Management and POS system. This system provides comprehensive business intelligence through detailed reports and visual analytics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. API Endpoints

#### Reports API (`/api/reports`)
- **GET** - Generate detailed reports in various formats
  - Query Parameters:
    - `type` - Report type (sales, inventory, profit, customer)
    - `startDate` - Start date for report period
    - `endDate` - End date for report period
    - `format` - Output format (json, csv)

### 2. Report Types

#### Sales Report
- Total sales transactions
- Revenue analysis
- Daily sales trends
- Top selling products
- Recent sales transactions

#### Inventory Report
- Product stock levels
- Low stock alerts
- Overstock alerts
- Inventory value by category
- Cost and profit analysis

#### Profit Report
- Revenue vs. cost of goods
- Gross and net profit calculations
- Profit margins
- Operating expenses tracking
- Profit trends over time

#### Customer Report
- Customer purchase history
- Top spending customers
- Customer lifetime value
- Purchase frequency analysis
- Customer segmentation

### 3. User Interface

#### Reports Dashboard
- Date range selection
- Export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- Tabbed interface for different report types
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Detailed data tables

#### Visualization Components
- Bar charts for product performance
- Line charts for trend analysis
- Pie charts for category breakdowns
- Area charts for revenue trends
- Data tables with sorting and filtering

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Data Models Used
- Sales data from `Sale` and `SaleItem` models
- Product information from `Product` model
- Customer data from `User` model
- Expense tracking from `Expense` model

#### Report Generation Logic
- Aggregation of transactional data
- Time-based filtering and grouping
- Statistical calculations for metrics
- Data transformation for visualization

### Frontend Components

#### React Components
- Reports page with tabbed interface
- Date range selector
- Chart components using Recharts library
- Data tables with responsive design
- Export functionality

#### State Management
- Redux for global state
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Loading states for async operations

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/reports`
Generate detailed business reports

**Query Parameters:**
- `type` (string, required) - Report type: sales, inventory, profit, customer
- `startDate` (string, optional) - ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `endDate` (string, optional) - ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `format` (string, optional) - Output format: json (default), csv

**Response Format (JSON):**
```json
{
  "reportType": "string",
  "startDate": "string",
  "endDate": "string",
  "data": {}
}
```

**Response Format (CSV):**
CSV formatted data based on report type

**Example Request:**
```
GET /api/reports?type=sales&startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All report endpoints require authentication
- JWT token validation through NextAuth
- Role-based access control

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) for database queries
- Session context setting for user-specific data
- Data filtering based on user permissions

## Performance Optimization

### Database Queries
- Efficient aggregation queries
- Proper indexing on date fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed reports

### Frontend Optimization
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Virtualized lists for large data tables
- Debounced API calls for date range changes
- Loading states for better UX

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Analytics
- Predictive sales forecasting
- Customer behavior analysis
- Seasonal trend identification
- Inventory demand planning

### Export Features
- PDF report generation
- Excel export with formatting
- Scheduled report delivery
- Custom report templates

### Visualization Improvements
- Interactive dashboards
- Real-time data updates
- Custom chart configurations
- Exportable charts and graphs

## Usage Examples

### Generate Sales Report
```javascript
// Fetch sales report for January 2024
const response = await fetch('/api/reports?type=sales&startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31');
const data = await response.json();
```

### Export Inventory Report as CSV
```javascript
// Export inventory report as CSV
const response = await fetch('/api/reports?type=inventory&format=csv');
const blob = await response.blob();
// Trigger download
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses
- 401 Unauthorized - Missing or invalid authentication
- 400 Bad Request - Invalid parameters
- 500 Internal Server Error - Processing failures

### Client-Side Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Fallback UI for loading states

## Testing

### API Testing
- Unit tests for report generation functions
- Integration tests for endpoint responses
- Performance tests for large datasets

### UI Testing
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- Responsive design validation

## Deployment Considerations

### Scalability
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies for reports
- Load balancing for high-traffic periods

### Monitoring
- API usage tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring

This reporting system provides comprehensive business intelligence capabilities essential for effective inventory and sales management.
